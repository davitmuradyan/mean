    <h1>Guides to follow before submitting a solution</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
    You need to follow the guideline in order to have successfully submitted solution. Currently we are supporting 3 types of user inputs.
    You need to write your code, assuming that user will enter one of these 3 types. It can be either an array of integers(1,2,3,4), it can be
    just a single integer(1 or 5.3) or it can be a function. <strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong> if your case is the third one, you should be careful to parse
    the user input correctly. Here you can also find the examples.

  <div class="row justify-content-md-start">
    Other points you should consider:
    <ul>
      <li>Name of the function must be the same both in input and in the code.</li>
      <li>Your function must have exactly the same number of parameters as you mention in the number of parameters input</li>
      <li>The names of parameters must be the same both in code and in the input</li>
      <li>Test case input should be in the format, by which users are going to write it</li>
      <li>Your function must take the test case input, process it and return the test case output</li>
      <li>If the number of parameters is more than 1 you should split them with pipe |</li>
    </ul>
    Example:
    <input class="form-control" type="text" value="5 | 6">
  </div>
  <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
    <h3>Take an example of sum calculation</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
    <code>
      function calculateSum(set) {{ '{' }}
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; const arr = set.split(',');
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; const sum = arr.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur);
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; return sum;
      <br>
      }
    </code>
  </div>
  <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
    So you need to split user input as it will be comma separated numbers. After splitting you calculate the sum and return it.
